This project contains the theme assignment from theme 9.

In this folder you'll find markdown files and pdf files. The markdown can be knitted to produce the pdf file, but for convenience this already has been done.
There are two files, the logbook and the results. 
	The logbook is an entire summary of the project and includes the exploratory data analysis. 
	The results are separated from the logbook is fully readable on its own.
